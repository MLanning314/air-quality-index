## Final Project: Predicting Air Quality in India

### Description
This project is a model building and analysis to find the best model to predict the air quality index value given the concentrations of different pollutants.

Through the analysis of the metric RSQ, I found the best model - using a variety of recipes, models (both parametric and nonparametric), and hyperparameters when applicable - for my predictive regression problem. 

More details of this project, my process, and my results can be found in `Lanning_Mackenzie_final_report`.

### Directories
- `data/`: contains the raw and cleaned data, and a codebook for the cleaned data
- `data_splits/`: contains four separate datasets created in the initial setup for the modeling process: the initial split dataset, the resamples dataset, the training dataset, and the testing dataset.
- `memos/`: contains the first and second progress memos that provide updates on the project throughout the course
- `r_scripts/`: contains all R-scripts where the splitting, recipe creation, model fitting/tuning, and model analysis takes place
- `recipes/`: contains all preprocessing/feature engineering recipes used to define, fit, and tune models
- `results/`: contains results from training/fitting models to resamples as well as some results tables
