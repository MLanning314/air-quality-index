# Final Project: Predicting Air Quality in India
## Progress Memos

### Overview
This folder contains the information needed for my progress memos that were completed throughout the quarter.

These memos aim to direct our project and ensure proper progress is being made, as well as provide a short summary of what we plan on doing for the project.
